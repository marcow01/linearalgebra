GAUSS-JORDAN ELIMINATION ALGORITHM ON 3X4 MATRIX

### 1. `gauss.c`
This program applies the **Gauss-Jordan elimination method** to a \( 3 \times 4 \) matrix (augmented matrix) and presents its reduced row echelon form (RREF) as the result.

### 2. `inverse.c`
This program applies the **Gauss-Jordan elimination method** to a \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix to find its inverse (if it exists). It also demonstrates the Gauss-Jordan elimination process on the augmented matrix \([A | I]\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.
